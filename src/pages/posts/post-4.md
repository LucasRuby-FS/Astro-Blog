title: How to Build an API, A Step-by-Step Guide.
author: Ruby Lucas/The Postman Team
description:
  "When you start to build an API, there are a few steps to consider. First you understand the API's use case. You define what your API will do and identify the resources it will handle. You will ALWAYS choose your tools before selecting a framework and language for building your API. Do your research on patterns and best practices that makes APIs maintainable and developer-friendly.
  You will gather information on how resources relate to each other and then decide on data formats. When you build API's you will create models, routes, and controllers to handle requests. You can use Postman to verify that your API endpoints work correctly. "
